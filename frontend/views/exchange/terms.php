                        <h4>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h4>
                        <p>The Terms and Conditions governs the issuance of
                            certificates of IOUs (referred as "colored coins")
                            by Lykke Corp UK Ltd., full subsidiary of Lykke Corp
                            (referred as "Lykke").</p>
                        <p>Lykke is a FinTech company building a global
                            marketplace with settlement on the blockchain using
                            colored coins technology.</p>
                        <h4>TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE</h4>
                        <p>Lykke is using distributed ledger technology
                            (referred as "blockchain" or "distributed ledger")
                            for providing the services, including issuance,
                            transfers and exchange of colored coins. The
                            services are based on the Open Assets protocol. Open
                            Assets is a colored coin implementation based on the
                            OP_RETURN operator. Metadata is linked from the
                            blockchain and stored on the web. See <a
                                href="http://www.openassets.org/">www.openassets.org</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>For communication with the distributed ledger, client
                            application has been created for mobile iOS and
                            Android operating system. To own and exchange
                            colored coins the Lykke Wallet mobile app needs to
                            be downloaded and installed.</p>
                        <p>This document might not contain the entire
                            information considered important by the interested
                            parties. Since the blockchain technology is
                            relatively new, Lykke will start testing the new
                            colored coins issue carefully, on a limited scale
                            and by using a design that serves to minimise
                            risks.</p>
                        <h4>LEGAL FRAMEWORK</h4>
                        <p>The precondition for the purchase and redemption of
                            the colored coins is a customer relationship with
                            Lykke. In the establishment of the relationship,
                            Lykke thus adheres, among other things, to the
                            obligations arising from the Money Laundering and
                            Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.</p>
                        <h4>BASIC CONDITIONS FOR THE ISSUANCE</h4>
                        <p>The colored coins shall be freely transferable and
                            exchangeable, subject to the limitations arising
                            from the legal acts of EU and other countries. The
                            issue of the colored coins shall not be registered
                            under the legal acts any other country. The colored
                            coins may not thus be sold or offered for sale in
                            any country, where a previous registration or other
                            formalities are required for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Any payments to be made by Lykke and the holder of
                            the colored coin in connection with the colored
                            coins shall be made in bitcoins.</p>

                            colored coin has the right to return the colored
                            coin to Lykke and request fulfilment of the
