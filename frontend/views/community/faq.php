                                    <p>Potentially, but unlikely. As with any
                                        stock, instant liquidity is not
                                        guaranteed. Lykke has reserved ten
                                        percent of the funds raised for a
                                        liquidity pool and will be raising more
                                        outside funds for an investment pool
                                        that will purchase Lykke coins. In
                                        general, the company aims to help
                                        provide as much liquidity as possible.
                                        As more people own and want the coins,
                                        liquidity will increase. If, for some
                                        reason, fewer people want the coins,
                                        liquidity will decrease.</p>

                                    <p>A financial market has to provide
                                        liquidity and ensure that there is a
                                        buyer, whenever someone wants to sell.
                                        Interest rate payments are a core
                                        mechanism to incentivize market

                                        asset. A major innovation of the Lykke
                                        marketplace is intraday interest
                                        payments. The batch-based system of the
                                        existing market infrastructure has been
                                        an obstacle to intraday interest rate
                                        payments and has been a major reason for
                                        the disjointed price movements in

                                    <p>The distributed ledger technology is the

                                        in the chain of blocks, where the
                                        consistency of data is guaranteed by the
                                        cryptography and consensus of multiple
                                        nodes. The pioneer and the most popular
                                        implementation of the DLT is the
                                        Blockchain of Bitcoin.</p>

                                        costs. This will pave the way for the
                                        emergence of a global marketplace for
                                        all asset classes and instruments that
                                        uses this system.</p>
                                    <p>The distributed ledger technology
                                        facilitates step-by-step transactions.
                                        If contracting parties A and B decide to
                                        exchange assets X and Y, the transfer
                                        occurs synchronous and step-by-step; it
                                        cannot happen that just one side of the
                                        transaction is executed. The distributed
                                        ledger technology operates on a global
                                        scale and is a notary service. The
                                        technology is highly efficient and
                                        dramatically reduces risks associated
                                        with any type of transactions.</p>

                                    <p>The distributed ledger technology is one

                                        humankind, because contracting parties
                                        can execute transactions step by step
                                        independent of location and have direct
                                        ownership. The step-by-step procedure is
                                        a safeguard against any misbehavior or
                                        fraud between transacting parties and
                                        dramatically reduces the risk associated

                                        reduces complexity.</p>

                                        used to record ownership of literally
                                        all types of financial assets. A new
                                        global marketplace will evolve, where
                                        all types of assets and instruments will
                                        be traded. Literally everyone will have
                                        direct access to this market as is the
                                        case for the Internet itself. The market
                                        will be a level playing field, where any
                                        financial asset can be traded directly
                                        for any other asset and instrument. The

                                        transactions were only possible, when
                                        individuals had face-to-face contact. A
                                        shopping experience at the local bakery
                                        illustrates this point: the buyer points
                                        to the bread that he wants to buy. The
                                        shop assistant places the bread on the
                                        counter and when the customer has put
                                        the money on the counter, he can take
                                        the bread and leave. At any time, the
                                        shop assistant or customer can interrupt
                                        the process.</p>
                                    <p>If transactions take place between

                                        step-by-step procedure is not feasible.
                                        An online shopping experience
                                        illustrates the issue; the merchant, who
                                        sells a product online for 50 EUR, can
                                        book the receipt of a 50 EUR credit card
                                        payment, but actual settlement of this
                                        transaction occurs days or weeks later,
                                        when he receives the money. During this
                                        period, the merchant is at risk that the
                                        payment might not occur for any reason.
                                        Delivery and settlement of financial
                                        transactions, be they stock purchases,
                                        buying or selling of currencies or other

                                        deficiency. Today, delivery and
                                        settlement of financial transactions is
                                        batch-based and occurs with a delay of
                                        two or more business days. This leads to
                                        exponential accumulation of risk with
                                        specific counterparties, who are

                                        Initially, the Lykke marketplace will

                                        ledger technology for any type of
                                        financial instrument. A financial
                                        institution can for example buy one
                                        Bitcoin on the market and then divide
                                        this one Bitcoin into million
                                        increments. It can then use each one of
                                        those increments as a so-called colored
                                        coin and specify with the colored coin
                                        protocol the terms and conditions of
                                        that particular financial instrument.

                                    <p>A colored coin issued by the financial
                                        institution may represent a share of the
                                        company itself, or represent any type of
                                        ‘IOU’, such as the commitment to make a
                                        payment of X EUR in n days to the holder
                                        of the colored coin, if so requested.
                                        The colored coin protocol makes it
                                        possible to use the distributed ledger
                                        technology to deliver and settle any
                                        type of financial transaction of any
                                        asset within minutes. Colored coins can
                                        have International Securities
                                        Identification Numbers (ISINs) to map
                                        them into the existing back office and
                                        risk management systems of banks making
                                        the system compatible with the existing
                                        financial architecture.</p>
                                    <p>Issuers of colored coins will buy virtual
                                        currencies to securitize financial
                                        assets, but they can use a small
                                        fraction of a Bitcoin to issue a colored
                                        coin. One Bitcoin can be sliced into one
                                        million increments; so in theory a
                                        colored coin needs to only include ‘1
                                        millionth of a Bitcoin’ (1 Satoshi); if
                                        Bitcoins trade at a price of 300 USD per
                                        Bitcoin, the intrinsic value of the
                                        virtual currency per colored coin will
                                        be 0.0003 USD, a negligible amount
                                        compared to the market value of the
                                        colored coin. The price volatility of
                                        Bitcoin will therefore not impact the
                                        market price of colored coins.</p>

                                    <p>The colored coin protocol allows any
                                        issuer to use a Satoshi (1 millionth of
                                        Bitcoin) as a piece of paper and specify
                                        the terms and conditions of the ‘IOU’
                                        that he intends to issue.</p>
                                    <p>Bank AAA for example can specify the
                                        following: holder of this color coin is
                                        entitled to receive 1 million USD, if he
                                        hands it over.</p>
                                    <p>If someone has a bank account with Bank
                                        AAA, he can request that his assets (1
                                        million USD) be converted into a Bank’s
                                        colored coin for 1 million USD. He can
                                        then use his Bank’s colored coin to buy
                                        and sell other colored coins of this
                                        Bank or of other issuers, for that
                                        matter.</p>
                                    <p>Settlement with the real world is
                                        straight forward - the holder of Bank’s
                                        colored coins of USD converts the
                                        colored coin into a regular balance of
                                        USD account at Bank AAA.</p>
                                    <p>It is obvious that such a system only
                                        works well, if the marketplace offers
                                        efficient price discovery. Lykke plans
                                        to implement a new type of matching
                                        engine (price, time and spread queuing),
                                        which is more efficient than the
                                        traditional approach (only price and
                                        time queuing) in preventing price
                                        spikes.</p>

                                    <p>Lykke is a semi-centralized exchange.
                                        This means that the exchange does not
                                        take possession of the traded coins, but
                                        needs to be trusted to match trades
                                        correctly. Lykke has a centralized
                                        matching engine and decentralized coins
                                        settlement. Matched trades are settled
                                        on a blockchain in atomic way. Each
                                        atomic transaction must be signed both
                                        by parites and exchange. Still to be
                                        able to trade, one should deposit his
                                        coins into Lykke exchange. Depositing
                                        coins is not equal to trusting coins.
                                        How can it be? Lykke uses
                                        multisignatures mechanism to hold
                                        client's funds. Lykke can not spend
                                        coins without client's private key. Even
                                        if the exchange is compromised and the
                                        Lykke's key is stolen, the client will
                                        not lose his coins. The second key is
                                        required to spend deposited coins. Lykke
                                        exchange also provides refund mechanism
                                        to guarantee funds recovery in case of
                                        emergency.</p>
