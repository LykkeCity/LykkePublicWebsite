                        <p>The Lykke marketplace uses the distributed ledger, which is blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin.</p>
                        <p>This technology incorporates a protocol for decentralized data storage in the chain of blocks, where the consistency of the data is guaranteed by the cryptography and consensus of multiple nodes.</p>

                        <p>The blockchain makes it possible to create a global marketplace that will be a level playing field, where any financial asset can be traded directly for any other asset or instrument.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><div class="li">It's decentralized. There is no central authority in the blockchain, so no one can manipulate the data or block the procedures.</div></li>
                            <li><div class="li">It's secure. The blockchain enables people who do not know each other to build a global notary service. The step-by-step procedure is a safeguard against fraud, and it reduces the risk associated with transactions.</div></li>
                            <li><div class="li">It's easily accessible. Everyone will be able to have free access to the marketplace from any location, just like with the Internet.</div></li>
                            <li><div class="li">It's peer-to-peer. There is no intermediary, transaction costs are low, and transactions are faster than in many existing systems.</div></li>
                            <li><div class="li">It supports direct ownership. Contracting parties can immediately have direct ownership, which reduces complexity.</div></li>
