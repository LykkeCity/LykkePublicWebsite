                            <h4>Order Types</h4>
                            <h5>Limit order</h5>
                            <p>A limit order stipulates a maximum purchase price or minimum selling price. If not fully matched, the remainder of the order is stored in the order book in descending buy-price order or ascending sell-price order and joins the queue of orders having the same price according to time priority. If the price specified by a limit price is not valid according to the allowed tick sizes, it will be rejected. It will only execute at prices equal to or more generous than its specified limit price. Limit orders can be matched in part or in its entirety.</p>

                            <h5>Market order</h5>
                            <p>A market order is an order to sell or buy at the best available price and is therefore entered without a price. During continuous trading the time in force for a market order is always fill-or-kill (the order is matched in full or not at all). The order is never registered in the order book. Note that a market order will trade through the order book until the entire quantity is filled. This means that as long as there is an order on the opposite side of the order book there will be a match no matter the price level.</p>

                            <h4>Time in Force</h4>
                            <p>LykkeX supports GTC (Good till Cancelled) orders in markets that have no specified limit to the maximum number of days an order is allowed to stay in the book. In fact, GTC is the only order type allowed.</p>

                            <h3>Order Modification</h3>
                            <p>All the changes such as increase or decrease of the quantity or change of the price are equivalent to the cancellation of the order and the placing of a new order with a new ranking timestamp.</p>

                            <h3>Ranking of Orders</h3>
                            <p>The main rule for ranking of orders is based firstly upon best price/net price and secondly by the longest storage time.</p>

                            <h3>Tick Sizes</h3>
                            <p>Tick size is the smallest allowed price movement and, thereby, is the smallest possible difference between the buy and sell price in an order book.</p>            </div>
